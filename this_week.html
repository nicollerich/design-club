    <p>Katie Rodgers created the site Paper Fashion in 2009 as an outlet to share her fantastical watercolors with the world. It has since taken her on an incredible journeyâ€¦ </p>
    <br>
    <p> Katie grew up in a small country town just outside of Atlanta, GA. Living in the country with three brothers, she would often escape into her own imaginative worlds. Her aunt gifted Katie her first professional set of watercolors before the age of 7, and needless to say, she fell head over heels in love with them. Fashion, whimsy, and nature have forever been lurking inside her mind and onto the blank pages of her watercolor blocks.</p>
