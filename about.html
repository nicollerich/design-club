				    <p>Design Club is an opportunity to bring in outside voices, and hear stories from other designers with varied work and career paths. It’s open internally to everyone, and we provide a live stream for remote employees. It’s a pretty informal, intimate gathering — a good environment for questions and conversation.</p>
